abstract="Usually if an application system requires some security features, these are either not available at all, or are incorporated by means of other software products. The security features offered by these security products are usually very limited, in the sense that the application system designer has to rely on the underlying platform's security measures, or add security features needed by the application system. This means that security is not considered until the operational requirements have been defined and the system is well into the implementation stage. This approach towards application system development poses a problem, since it is seldom possible to provide a good level of security on a retrofit basis, or in parallel but separate from the functional design. To overcome this problem, the security aspects associated with the development of an application system should be considered during the definition of user requirements and incorporated into the system during the design stages. This paper presents a methodology that addresses security requirements as part of system development, while simultaneously considering other functional requirements.",
